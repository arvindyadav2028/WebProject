Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB Atlas | HTML/CSS/JS | MVC Architecture
- Developed a dynamic web app where users can register, log in, and post room listings with rent and location.
- Integrated MongoDB Atlas for secure cloud-based data storage.
- Implemented authentication and access control; only listing owners can delete or modify their content.
- Followed clean MVC folder structure; used Node.js packages like express-session, etc.
- Booking system was planned as a future enhancement but not implemented due to time constraints.
